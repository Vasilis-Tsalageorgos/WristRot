Recent clinical tests have created an interest in the study of the rotation of the human wrist, as it is considered probable that this particular sort of movement is in correlation with erosion detected at the elbow joint. The anatomical terms of the movements that happen when the wrist rotates are pronation and supination. In pronation, the position of the palm changes from facing sideways to facing down, while in supination, the position of the palm changes from facing sideways to facing up.

WristRot is an application able to recognize and count movements of this sort, during any activity for any given time period, by utilizing smartwatch accelerometer data. Data is stored locally, and users are able to get an early idea about which of their activities are the most strenuous for the elbow joint.
